You are working on an existing website called ARAPOINT.
Do NOT rebuild the entire website.
Only extend the current education service.

GOAL:
Implement an automated Education PIN Inventory System for:
- WAEC
- NECO
- NABTEB
- NBAIS

IMPORTANT RULES:
- This system must use PRE-UPLOADED PIN INVENTORY.
- Do NOT use any external API for PIN generation.
- Do NOT implement JAMB e-PIN.
- One PIN must be sold to ONE customer only.
- No PIN must ever be reused.

DATABASE:
Create two tables if they do not exist:

1) education_pins
Fields:
- id (primary key)
- exam_type (waec, neco, nabtet, nbais)
- pin_code
- serial_number
- status (unused, used)
- used_by_order_id
- used_by_user_id
- used_at
- created_at

2) education_orders
Fields:
- id
- user_id
- exam_type
- amount
- status (pending, paid, completed, failed, refunded)
- pin_id
- created_at

ADMIN PANEL:
- Allow admin to upload PINs manually and via CSV.
- Admin must see PIN stock count per exam type.
- Disable purchase automatically when stock = 0.
- Admin can view used and unused PINs.
- Admin cannot reuse or edit used PINs.

CUSTOMER FLOW:
- Customer selects exam type and pays.
- After successful payment, create an order with status = "paid".
- Trigger ARP Robot to auto-assign a PIN.

ARP ROBOT LOGIC:
- When an order status becomes "paid":
    - Start a database transaction.
    - Select ONE unused PIN matching the exam type.
    - Lock the selected PIN row.
    - Mark the PIN as "used".
    - Link PIN to the order and user.
    - Mark order as "completed".
    - Deliver PIN instantly to the user dashboard and email.
- If no unused PIN exists:
    - Mark order as "failed".
    - Refund the user wallet automatically.
    - Notify admin that stock is empty.

SECURITY:
- Use database transactions and row locking.
- Assign PIN before sending to customer.
- Prevent race conditions.
- Never expose the PIN list publicly.

FRONTEND:
- Show "Instant Delivery" for WAEC, NECO, NABTEB, NBAIS.
- Show warning: "No refund after PIN delivery".

OUTPUT:
- Implement clean, maintainable code.
- Integrate smoothly into the existing Arapoint system.
- Do not break existing services.
